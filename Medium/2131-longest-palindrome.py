2131. Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome-by-concatenating-two-letter-words/

#tags: hashmap, palindrome, string, greedy

Approach:
- Count the frequency of each two-letter word using a hash map.
- For each word, try to pair it with its reverse (e.g., 'ab' with 'ba').
- Special handling for palindromic words like 'aa', 'bb', etc. â€” keep one in the center if there's an odd count.

Time: O(n), we iterate over the list once and then over the unique words (which is at most 676, i.e., 26*26).
Space: O(n), for storing word frequencies in a hash map.
